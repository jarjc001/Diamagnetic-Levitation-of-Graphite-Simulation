My final year project for Bsc Physics at the University of Bath. 
"Simulating the levitation of Pyrolytic graphite above an array of N42 neodymium permanent magnets to study diamagnetic levitation"
I'm only showing the final report and the data collected from the simulation with the graphs relating to them.
