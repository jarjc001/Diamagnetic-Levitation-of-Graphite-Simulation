## Diamagnetic-Levitation-of-Graphite-Simulation 

Creating a simulation of pyrolytic graphite levitating in a magnetic field generated by an array of N42 neodymium permanent magnets to study diamagnetic levitation. By using experiments to measure the properties of these objects, the simulation could accurately calculate the stable levitation height as to agree with the physically measured results. The diamagnet’s levitation height was found to be dependent on its orientation relative to the magnet array and its surface area. This added to the already established factors: diamagnet’s magnetic susceptibility, the strength of the magnetic field and the diamagnet’s position in the magnetic field. For stable diamagnetic levitation to occur, two requirements were found. First, the magnet array needs to be arranged so that it creates an area of zero vertical magnetic flux density above the array. Second, the diamagnet needs to be in a shape with an even order of rotational symmetry, as to a have zero torque about the horizontal axes.

My final year project for Bsc Physics at the University of Bath. 
I'm only showing the final report and the data collected from the simulation with the graphs relating to them.
